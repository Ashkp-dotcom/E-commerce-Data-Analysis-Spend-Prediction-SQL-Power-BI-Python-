# E-commerce Data Analysis & Spend Prediction (SQL + Power BI + Python)

This end-to-end analytics project demonstrates how raw e-commerce event-level data was transformed using SQL, visualized with Power BI, and extended with a regression model in Python to predict user-level spending behavior.

---

## ðŸ›  Project Workflow

- **SQL**: Queried and aggregated raw sales data to build insights on traffic, revenue, and product performance.
- **Power BI**: Designed an interactive dashboard with KPIs, time-based trends, and dynamic filters.
- **Python (ML)**: Developed a regression model to predict total spending per user based on session features and behavior.
- **Data Analysis**: Delivered insights on engagement patterns, top brands, peak hours, and user segmentation.

## ðŸ¤– ML: Spend Prediction Using Linear Regression
- Aggregated user-level features from 144K+ event records (brand interactions, session counts, avg engagement time, etc.)
- Applied One-Hot Encoding, StandardScaler, and trained a Linear Regression model.
- **Model Performance**:  
  - **RÂ² Score**: 0.13  
  - **RMSE**: â‚¹427  
- Insight: Session-level behavior alone was not a strong predictor of user spending â€” deeper transactional signals may be required.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- **Brand Breakdown**: Samsung led in customer count, followed by Apple and Xiaomi.
- **Time Analysis**: Peak engagement occurred in the Afternoon and Evening.
- **Geographic Trends**: GA and KY were the top-performing states by revenue.
- **Product Focus**: Smartphones and Notebooks dominated revenue across both months.
